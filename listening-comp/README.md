## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Configure AWS Credentials
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your AWS credentials:
```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

### 3. AWS Bedrock Setup
1. Create an AWS account if you don't have one
2. Create an IAM user with programmatic access:
   - Sign in to AWS Management Console
   - Navigate to IAM service
   - Create a new user with "Programmatic access"
   - Attach the "AmazonBedrockFullAccess" policy
   - Save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

3. Enable Bedrock model access:
   - Navigate to Amazon Bedrock in AWS Console
   - Go to "Model access" in the left sidebar
   - Request access to the required models (e.g., amazon.nova-micro-v1:0)
   - Accept the terms of service

### 4. Run the Application
1. Build and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:8501
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000

3. To stop the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### AWS Access Issues

If you encounter this error:
```
Error generating response: An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the Converse operation: You don't have access to the model with the specified model ID.
```

Ensure that:
1. You've requested access to the model in the AWS Bedrock console
2. Your IAM user has the necessary permissions
3. The model ID in your code matches an available model in your account

### Docker Issues

If you encounter AWS credential issues in Docker:
1. Verify your `.env` file contains the correct AWS credentials
2. Check that the environment variables are properly set in the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec backend env | grep AWS
   ```
3. Ensure the AWS credentials have the necessary permissions
