# Mega Service Execution Summary

This document summarizes the execution of the mega service following the instructions in RUNNING.md.

## Environment Setup

1. Set environment variables:
```bash
export LLM_MODEL_ID=llama3.2:1b
export host_ip=$(ipconfig getifaddr en0)
export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1
```

2. Started Docker containers:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
- LLM server running on port 9002
- Grading server running on port 9003

3. Pulled models for both services:
```bash
# LLM server model
curl -X POST http://localhost:9002/api/pull -d '{"model": "llama3.2:1b"}'

# Grading server model
curl -X POST http://localhost:9003/api/pull -d '{"model": "llama3.2:1b"}'
```

4. Started the mega service:
```bash
python chat.py
```
- Service running on http://localhost:8000

5. Tested the service with a sample request:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "llama3.2:1b",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello, how are you?"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## Example Response Format

Below is an example of how the response from the service will be structured. Note that this is just a template showing the expected format - actual responses will have real values:

```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-<unique_id>",        // Example: "chatcmpl-abc123"
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": <timestamp>,              // Example: 1710777600
  "model": "llama3.2:1b",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "<translated_response>"  // Example: "Ciao! Come stai?"
      },
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": <number>,         // Example: 7
    "completion_tokens": <number>,     // Example: 5
    "total_tokens": <number>           // Example: 12
  },
  "grade": {
    "score": <score_between_0_and_1>,  // Example: 0.95
    "feedback": "<evaluation_feedback>" // Example: "Excellent translation"
  }
}
```
