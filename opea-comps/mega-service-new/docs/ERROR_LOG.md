# Mega Service New Error Log

This document tracks the errors and issues encountered during the setup and testing of the mega-service-new application.

### 1. Docker Container Port Conflicts
**Error Message**: Port conflicts when starting Docker containers
**Status**: Resolved
**Description**: The original configuration had conflicting port mappings between services.
**Solution**: 
- Updated port mappings in docker-compose.yaml:
  - LLM server: 9002 (was 9000)
  - Grading server: 9003 (was 9001)
  - Mega service: 8000 (unchanged)

### 2. Model Pull Failures
**Error Message**: Failed to pull model "llama3.2:1b"
**Status**: Partially Resolved
**Description**: The model specified in the configuration (llama3.2:1b) was not available.
**Solution**:
- Changed to use available Ollama models
- Updated environment variables to use correct model names
**Note**: Need to verify which specific model versions are available and compatible

### 3. Service Communication Issues
**Error Message**: Connection refused between services
**Status**: Open
**Description**: The mega service is unable to communicate with the LLM and grading services.
**Issues**:
- Services not properly networked in Docker
- Environment variables not properly passed to containers
- Service discovery issues between containers

### 4. Response Format Mismatch
**Error Message**: Invalid response format from services
**Status**: Open
**Description**: The responses from the LLM and grading services don't match the expected format.
**Issues**:
- LLM service response format doesn't match ChatCompletionResponse
- Grading service response format needs to be standardized
- Response parsing in chat.py needs improvement

## Known Issues

### 1. Service Orchestration
- **Status**: Open
- **Description**: The ServiceOrchestrator is not properly managing the flow between services
- **Proposed Solutions**:
  - Review service registration process
  - Verify flow configuration
  - Add better error handling for service communication

### 2. Environment Configuration
- **Status**: Open
- **Description**: Environment variables and configuration are not properly propagated
- **Proposed Solutions**:
  - Review environment variable setup
  - Add configuration validation
  - Implement better error messages for missing configuration

### 3. Docker Networking
- **Status**: Open
- **Description**: Docker containers are not properly networked
- **Proposed Solutions**:
  - Review Docker network configuration
  - Add explicit network configuration
  - Implement container health checks

## Required Fixes

1. **Docker Configuration**
   ```yaml
   # Update docker-compose.yaml
   services:
     llm-server:
       ports:
         - "9002:11434"
     grading-server:
       ports:
         - "9003:11434"
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Required environment variables
   export LLM_MODEL_ID=llama3.2:1b
   export host_ip=$(ipconfig getifaddr en0)
   export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1
   ```

3. **Service Communication**
   - Implement proper service discovery
   - Add health checks
   - Improve error handling

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Verify Docker container networking
   - Test service communication
   - Validate environment variables

2. **Short-term Improvements**
   - Add proper logging
   - Implement health checks
   - Add configuration validation

3. **Long-term Improvements**
   - Implement proper service discovery
   - Add monitoring and metrics
   - Improve error handling and recovery
