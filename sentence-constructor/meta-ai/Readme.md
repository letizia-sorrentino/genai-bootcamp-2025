### **How to Craft Effective Prompts**
1. **Be Clear & Specific** â€“ Provide detailed instructions for more precise outputs.
2. **Use Examples** â€“ Show sample inputs and expected responses to guide the model.
3. **Iterate & Refine** â€“ Experiment with different phrasing to improve results.
4. **Avoid Ambiguity** â€“ Use explicit language to ensure the model understands your intent.
5. **Leverage Role-Based Prompts** â€“ Assign roles to guide responses with greater relevance and accuracy.
6. **Utilise Chain of Thought** â€“ Break down complex prompts into logical steps for improved reasoning.
7. **Apply Few-Shot Learning** â€“ Provide multiple examples to refine model accuracy.

### **Advanced Prompting Techniques**
- **Self-Consistency**: Running multiple responses and selecting the most frequent answer for accuracy.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Integrating external data for fact-based responses.
- **Program-Aided Language Models**: Using code execution for calculations and logical tasks.
- **Minimising Hallucinations**: Providing clear context, verifying sources, and enforcing factual accuracy.
- **Limiting Extraneous Tokens**: Ensuring responses are concise and directly relevant.
