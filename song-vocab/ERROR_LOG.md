# Error Log

This document tracks the errors encountered during development and testing of the Italian Song Vocabulary API.

## 2024-03-21

### 1. Ollama Model Response Format Error
**Error Message**: `'\\n    \"words\"'`
**Status**: Resolved
**Description**: The Mistral model was returning malformed responses during vocabulary extraction.
**Solution**: 
- Restarted Ollama service
- Verified model installation
- Added better error handling in `extract_vocabulary.py`

### 2. Web Search Fallback Issues
**Error Message**: No specific error message, but search results were inconsistent
**Status**: Partially Resolved
**Description**: The primary search method (DuckDuckGo) was failing to find Italian lyrics consistently.
**Solution**:
- Implemented multiple fallback mechanisms:
  1. DuckDuckGo search
  2. Direct Google search
  3. Hardcoded fallback URLs for testing
**Note**: The hardcoded fallback to Eros Ramazzotti's song is a temporary solution and needs to be replaced with a more robust mechanism.

### 3. Content Extraction Validation
**Error Message**: "Content not in Italian"
**Status**: Resolved
**Description**: The content extraction tool was sometimes returning non-Italian content.
**Solution**:
- Added Italian language validation
- Improved content cleaning and formatting
- Added better error handling for malformed content

### 4. Database Connection Issues
**Error Message**: "Database connection failed"
**Status**: Resolved
**Description**: SQLite database operations were failing intermittently.
**Solution**:
- Added connection pooling
- Implemented retry logic for database operations
- Added proper error handling for database operations

## Known Issues

### 1. Web Search Reliability
- **Status**: Open
- **Description**: Web search results are not consistently finding Italian lyrics
- **Proposed Solutions**:
  - Implement more robust search algorithms
  - Add more fallback sources
  - Improve search query formatting

### 2. Model Response Format
- **Status**: Open
- **Description**: Occasional malformed responses from the Mistral model
- **Proposed Solutions**:
  - Implement stricter response validation
  - Add retry logic with different prompts
  - Consider using a different model version

### 3. Cache Management
- **Status**: Open
- **Description**: Cache invalidation strategy needs improvement
- **Proposed Solutions**:
  - Implement TTL (Time To Live) for cache entries
  - Add cache size limits
  - Implement cache cleanup routines

## Error Prevention Strategies

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize search queries
   - Check for empty or malformed requests

2. **Service Health Checks**
   - Monitor Ollama service status
   - Check database connectivity
   - Verify web search functionality

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Implement retry mechanisms
   - Use fallback services
   - Maintain backup data sources

4. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Log all errors with context
   - Monitor error patterns
   - Track resolution times

## Future Improvements

1. **Error Handling**
   - Implement more detailed error messages
   - Add error tracking system
   - Improve error recovery mechanisms

2. **Testing**
   - Add more comprehensive error testing
   - Implement automated error detection
   - Create error simulation scenarios

3. **Documentation**
   - Keep this error log updated
   - Document new error patterns
   - Maintain troubleshooting guides
